# InvoiceForMamu
This is a invoice prototype of the actual invoice generator I made for a local pharmacy.
Now what does it do?

1. Real time calculations: no need to use extra calculators instead use your hand just to make the inputs only.
2. Download invoice: Get invoice after generating it, now print it, share it or do whatever you do with a normal pdf.
